Wenfang Yao is currently a Post-doctoral Fellow at the [School of Nursing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/sn/), [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) under supervision of [Prof. Jing (Harry) Qin](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/sn/people/academic-staff/prof-harry-qin/). Prior to that, she obtained the Ph.D. degree from the [department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaoqi Yang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-yang--xiaoqi/), and the Bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Mathematics at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/).

She studied related Lipschitz-like property with projectional coderivatives in variational analysis for her Ph.D. research. Her research focus has recently transitioned to healthcare analytics. She is particularly interested in multi-modal fusion (e.g., fusing electronic healthcare records and chest X-ray images) for clinical predictions.
